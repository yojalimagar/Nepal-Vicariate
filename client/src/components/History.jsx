            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6 ml-20 mr-20 text-justify">

              The first Catholic missionaries to come to the Eastern Himalayas were two Portuguese Jesuit Priests
              Fr. Stephen Cacella and Fr John Cabral in the seventeenth century. They set out from their Portuguese
              base in Cochin on an expedition to Tibet in August 1626. They travelled through Hooghly in Bengal and
              passing through Gyantse they reached Lhasa.Fr Stephen Cacella died in Tibet and Fr. John Cabral returned
              to India through Nepal in 1632. He was graciously received by the King of that time, probably King Lakshminara
              Simha Malla of Kathmandu. <br />

              The first attempt for a more permanent presence in Nepal dates from a special session of the Congregation
              for the Propagation of the Faith in Rome on 14 March 1703 when it was decided to open a mission in Tibet
              which would include a section of the North India and the whole of what now is Nepal. This new enterprise
              was assigned to the Italian Capuchin Fathers. The first Capuchins set out from Europe in May of 1704. Of
              the six who set out for Tibet two died during the journey, one was put ashore at Cyprus, too ill to carry
              on; one remained at Chandanagore in West Bengal, India. Only two were able to set out from India for Tibet.
              They arrived in Kathmandu on 21 February 1707 but stayed only long enough to arrange their journey to Tibet,
              departing on 12 June 1707. The first part of their work was beset with many difficulties; illness, lack of manpower and resources. <br />

              It was only after a reorganization in 1714 that the Capuchins were able to send three men to open a more
              permanent station in Nepal. They arrived in the kingdom of Kathmandu where they were favor-ably received
              by the King in January 1715. <br />

              Over the next fifty four years, despite many difficulties arising from suspicions, misunderstandings,
              lack of manpower and material re-sources their work grew and the Capuchins extended their service to the
              kingdoms of Bhaktapur and Patan. In addition to this, they were in contact with the Kings of both Gorkha and
              Tanahun. On 18 November 1737 King Ranajita Malla of Bhaktapur issued a Decree of Liberty of Conscience in favour
              of the fathers. King Jayaprakash Malla of Kathmandu had issued a similar decree in the previous month. On 24 March
              1760 Fr. Tranquillus blessed a small Church, situated in Wotu Tole in Kathmandu under the title of the Assumption of Our Lady. 
              There was also a small chapel in Bhaktapur dedicated to Our Lady under the title Annunciation and another chapel in Patan. <br />

              In 1744 King Prithvi Narayan Shah of Gorkha had begun his military campaign that ultimately ended in the conquest and unification 
              of the three kingdoms of the valley in 1769. The Capuchin Fathers had known Prithvi Narayan Shah earlier and were on friendly terms 
              with him providing medical aid to his brother who was wounded in an attack on Kirtipur. Towards the end of this period, however, when 
              King Jayaprakash Malla of Kathmandu sought the help of the East India Company in his fight against Gorkha, suspicion fell on the Capuchins 
              as having been involved in this scheme. After the Gork-hali conquest of the valley this suspicion hardened. This suspicion, plus the lack of 
              manpower and resources, made the position of the Capuchins, who numbered only three at that time, untenable. They asked the new King for 
              permission to leave Nepal. Permission was given for one of them to leave and Father Joseph of Rovato left the valley on 4 February 1769 with
               some fifty-seven Christians who settled at Chuhari, India where their descendants still live. Within a few weeks the remaining two Capuchins,
                who had been retained as a sort of hostages against any further interference from the plains, were given permission to leave. <br />

              The Capuchins left Nepal with a promise to return and it was only in 1786 they were in a position to fulfill their promise.
               In that year Father Joseph of St. Marcello came to Nepal where he stayed for three years. He was joined by Fr. Charles Mary for one year.
                Lack of manpower in India forced the superiors in the plains to recall Fr. Joseph in 1789. Again in 1794 Fr. Joseph along with Fr. Romuald 
                of Senigallia returned to Nepal. After a few months Fr. Romuald was forced to leave because of ill health, but Fr. Joseph stayed on until 
                his death in Kathmandu on 9 November 1810. <br />

              In 1814 war broke out between Nepal and the East India Company. The treaty of Sugauli of 1816 brought an end to the war, but one stipulation
               of that treaty stated that the King of Nepal must not "Take or retain in his service any British subject, nor the subject of any European 
               and American State, without the consent of the Brit-ish Government." This stipulation effectively closed the borders of Nepal to all 
               foreigners, and both sides observed the stipulation until Indian Independence in 1947. <br />

              From the early decades of the last century, tribal people from Bihar particularly present day Jharkhand State, started coming to East Nepal 
              in search of employment in the tea gardens. A number of these people were Catholics. Priests from the North Bihar region bordering Eastern 
              Nepal kept visiting incognito, these Catholics who had migrated to Nepal, at least from the early 1940's. However no systematic ministry was
               possible due to the prevailing condition in the country at that time. <br />

              In 1949 Fr. Marshall Moran SJ, then Principal of St. Xavier's school in Patna was asked by the University to go to Nepal to supervise the 
              annual examinations at Trichandra College, then affiliated to Patna University. On 1 October 1949 he crossed the border into Nepal from Raxaul.
               While in Nepal he was taken to meet the Prime Minister, Mohan Shamsher Janga Bahadur Rana, who raised the question of the possibility 
               of opening of a school in Nepal similar to St. Xavier's in Patna. Negotiations were begun and a year later on 1 November 1950, General Mrigendra S.S Rana,
                the Director of public education, arrived in Patna to inform Fr. Moran that the Government of Nepal was inviting him to open a school 
                at Godavari. Within a few days, however, the Rana Government was overthrown by King Tribhuvan. Further planning had to await confirmation
                 by the New Government. In March of 1951 formal approval came from the Government through the Minister of Education, Mr. Nrip Jung Rana. <br />

              Fr. Moran returned to Kathmandu in May 1951 to prepare for the opening of Godavari school, The new School was opened on 1 July 1951 with 
              three Jesuits, Fathers Moran, Francis Murphy and Edwin Saxton, two Nepali teachers and sixty-five students, classes one to six. Facilities 
              at Godavari soon proved inadequate for the growing number of students and in September of 1954 Father Moran acquired a piece of property in 
              Jawalakhel for the primary section of the school. St. Xavier's Jawalakhel opened officially on 8 September 1954. <br />

              Since the Jesuits belonged to Patna diocese their work was consid-ered part of the mission of diocese of Patna. On his first pastoral 
              visit to Nepal in November of 1954 Bishop Wildermuth of Patna brought with him from Patna two IBMV Sisters, Sr. Benigna and Sr.Rita, to 
              explore the possibility of the Sisters offering education to the girls of Nepal. The proposal met with approval of the government and 
              three Sisters arrived on 27 January 1955 to open St. Mary's school. <br />

              From these humble beginnings the Church in Nepal spread to other ice, research, areas and was engaged in a variety of works, social service,
               education for the poor and disadvantaged, pastoral and animation programmes. In 1983 after the Government of Nepal requested dip-lomatic
                relations between Nepal and Holy See, the Vatican separated Nepal from the Patna diocese and erected a 'Missio Sui Iuris (Self. governing
                 Catholic Mission) on 7 October 1983. After six months, Pope John Paul II appointed Msgr. Anthony Sharma, the first native Catholic priest
                  of the Jesuit order as its first Ecclesiastical Superior of Nepal. Archbishop Agostino Cacchiavillian presented his credentials to the 
                  King as the first Pro-Nuncio in 1985. He was succeeded by Archbishop George Zur and Archbishop Lorenzo Baldisseri. In July 2003, 
                  Archbishop Pedro Lopez Quintana presented his creden-tials and became the fourth Nuncio to Nepal. With these events the Church 
                  in Nepal entered a new era, it was no longer an appendage to an Indian diocese but a Church in its own right. The Holy See appointed 
                  His Excellency Archbishop Giambattista Diquattro as the new Apostolic Nuncio to Nepal in 2017. <br />

              After Msgr. Anthony Sharma took the responsibility to lead the Catholic Church of Nepal, church began expanding her presence outside Kathmandu 
              valley both to the East and to the West. Several missions were opened outside Kathmandu Valley and many Congre-gations of men and women were 
              invited to work in Nepal. It was a period of great political changes too, in Nepal, absolute monarchy along with its "Panchayathi" system of 
              governance was abolished and parliamentary democracy was introduced in the country. The new Constitution promulgated by the late King Birendra
               Bir Bikram Shah in 1991 gave freedom to practice one's religion provided that there was no attempt at conversion. In Part III article 19 of 
               the Constitution states, "Every person shall have the freedom to profess and practice his/her own religion as coming down to hereditarily 
               having due regard to traditional practices - provided that no per-son shall be entitled to convert the religion of any person." Msgr. Anthony Sharma
                tirelessly led the Catholic Church of Nepal as its Ecclesiastical Superior from the year 1984 to 1996 and from 1997 as Apostolic Prefect and then
                 from February 10, 2007 as the first Bishop of Nepal until he retired in 2014. Bishop Anthony Sharma passed away on December 8, 2015. <br />

              Bishop Paul Simick succeeded Bishop Antony Sharma in 2014. Paul Simick was born on 7 August 1963 at Gitdubling in Kalimpong and was ordained
               Priest on 9 April 1992. He was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Nepal on 25 May 2014 and was ordained Bishop on 29 June 2014 by the then
                Pro Nuncio to India and Nepal, Archbishop Salvatore Pennacchio. <br />
